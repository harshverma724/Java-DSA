## What is DSA ?

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science and programming. Data Structures are ways to store and organize data, while Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems.

## Key Topics in DSA

- Arrays and Strings: Basic building blocks for storing sequences of elements.
- Linked Lists: Dynamic data structure to store elements linearly.
- Stacks and Queues: Abstract data types for handling elements in a particular order.
- Trees: Hierarchical data structures with nodes.
- Graphs: Structures to represent networks of nodes and edges.
- Hashing: Efficient data retrieval through hash tables.
- Sorting and Searching: Algorithms to arrange and find data.
- Dynamic Programming: Method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- Greedy Algorithms: Making the optimal choice at each step.
- Backtracking: Technique for solving recursive problems by trying to build a solution incrementally.
